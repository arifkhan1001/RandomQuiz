# RandomQuiz
The app could scan a user-provided text file and automatically generate multiple-choice questions based on the content.

Project Description: Build a Python app that creates quizzes from any text or document input. The app could scan a user-provided text file and automatically generate multiple-choice questions based on the content.
Technologies to Use: Python, spaCy for text processing, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for keyword extraction, and possibly Flask to host it as a web service.
Unique Twist: Incorporate a self-learning algorithm that improves question generation accuracy over time based on user feedback.
